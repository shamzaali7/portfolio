                    <div className="about-description mr-6 about-des-box">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My first introduction to code was when I enrolled in a computer science course my freshman year of highschool. The main language used was Visual-Basic. In my junior year of highschool I took a Java course that presented to me a more commonly used language and the basic concepts that surround it such as if/switch statements, for/while loops, and functions. This helped build my knowledge of perceiving and understanding code at an early stage and was a good segue into higher-level programming.</div>
                    <div className="about-description ml-6 about-des-box">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second semester of my freshman year of college I enrolled into a computer science class that taught Java at an upper level. It served as a refresher of the basics as well as introducing class based components and object-oriented programming. This was an important stage in the development of my programming fundamentals.</div>
	                <div className="about-description mr-6 about-des-box">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the summer of 2022, I took a Udemy course on Java that was the perfect refresher to bring me back to pace with everything I had previously learned. The course furthered my knowledge of object oriented programming, and was also my first introduction to APIâ€™s and making simple fetch requests. It also provided me with an optimal level of preparation and was a perfect segue into the next step of my pursuit of building a career in software engineering.</div>
	                <div className="about-description ml-6 about-des-box">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;04 October, 2022, I enrolled into a software engineering bootcamp hosted by General Assembly. It was a 3 month long bootcamp with over 420 hours of hands-on experience with the software development lifecycle, full-stack development, multiple languages, frameworks/libraries, version-control system, object-oriented programming, API requests, JSON data, Databases, and other various technologies and deployment platforms. I am confident in my ability to use what I have learned and apply it in a production level setting.</div>
